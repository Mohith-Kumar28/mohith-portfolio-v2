              ey! I&apos;m Bob, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a painter turned software engineer from Daytona,
              Florida. I specialize in the backend, primarily Node and Rust, but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job.

              I currently work for Google on Google Photos. I also toss in my ¬¢2
              with the design systems teams from time to time (once an artist,

              Outside of work, I still love to paint. Any given Sunday
              you&apos;ll find me scribbling some happy clouds with my son ‚òÅÔ∏è I
              even teach courses online if you&apos;re looking to learn!

              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my
